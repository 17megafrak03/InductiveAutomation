latest release: v4.0.1

Still existing bugs:

- missing recipe handlers for JEI: ?bio reactor? (missing feature, not really a bug)
- missing transfer handlers for JEI: portable crafter, compression assembler (missing feature, not really a bug)
- Model loading errors displayed on startup for models that are not needed (doesn't influence gameplay)
- Unbreakable stone/glass can be broken by WitherSkull projectile (bug related to forge/minecraft's hard-coded explosion resistance handling)

- Energy display in portable Tesla-transmitter not localized correctly
- InterdimensionalWormhole linking inventories wrong
- Selection tool config Inventory not accepting Machine co-op synchronizer
- Item filters not working in some devices
